    "about": "Hey, Im Callum\n\n I am an adventurous traveler who loves to go to new places and try new things. I have a passion for rock climbing, and cinema, and love to play board games when I get a chance.\n\n Now the more interesting part that you're probably here for; I'm also an extremely passionate and dedicated ML and deep-learning practitioner who has working experience across the domain from building production-grade ML solutions in Insurance, or for high-scale messaging services in Tech, through to building intricate and efficient data pipelines using technologies and platforms such as Terraform, Bamboo, and AWS.\n\nI have extensive experience in building complex generative AI solutions, as well as developing and integrating scalable, cutting-edge evaluation suites for GenAI.\n\nCurrently, my main interests lie in optimization and learning to write the fastest code, particularly within PyTorch. I’m always looking for new ways to push performance boundaries and refine my techniques—whether that means fine-tuning model architectures or squeezing out every last bit of efficiency from deep-learning frameworks.",
